    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Hello, <b>I'm Cameron Payton</b>, a current Computer Science major at Hampton University.</br>
    I initially decided to go with computer science as my career path after looking up, <i>"top paying jobs for introverts"</i></br>
  on a random high school afternoon. However, as I progrees in my studies and developed projects of my own that I could truly say I am proud of, </br>
I gained a geniune passion for the field. Right now, I am not entirely sure about what I would like to pursue in the future.</br>
 But so far I am thinking of either becoming a machine learning engineer, full stack engineer, or running my own company(for-profit or non-profit doesn't matter to me/)</p>
    <h2>My Personal Goals</h2>
